# Moku-Family Framework Registry

The single source of truth for every **published Moku-family framework** the toolkit
knows how to teach (via a skill), index (plugin/property catalog), and keep current
(`/moku:upgrade` + the `moku-sync` maintenance skill).

This file is the integration point between three systems:

- **Skills** — each framework has a skill that teaches its API and patterns.
- **`/moku:upgrade`** — reads this registry to offer bumping any *depended-on* framework
  in a consumer project to its registry version (migrations `moku-web-version` /
  `moku-core-version` in [upgrade-migrations.md](upgrade-migrations.md)).
- **`moku-sync`** (local maintainer skill) — polls each framework's release source,
  detects new versions, and regenerates the skill + plugin index + this registry.

> **Extending to a new moku-family framework:** add one entry to the JSON block below,
> create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` + `skills/<name>/references/plugin-index.md` (copy the
> moku-web index), then run `moku-sync <name>`. No code changes — every consumer of this
> registry loops over its entries generically.

## Registry (machine-readable)

`knownVersion` is the last version this toolkit was synced against. `moku-sync` updates it
after a successful sync; a value behind the upstream latest is exactly the signal that
"there is something new." **Version-of-truth for detecting new releases is the npm registry
JSON** (`https://registry.npmjs.org/<npm>` → `dist-tags.latest`). `@moku-labs/web` ships an
upstream `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` (since 0.4.0) — the preferred structured catalog — which
`moku-sync` reads and cross-checks against `package.json` `exports` + `src/plugins/*`; when the
llms files and the source disagree, **the source wins** (observed at 1.6.1).
`@moku-labs/core` ships its own `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` since 0.1.1 (cross-check against
`src/index.ts`, the sole public-surface authority); pre-0.1.1 it had none.

> - **`2.1.0`:** `createChannel<T>(opts)` — a client realtime WebSocket primitive (top-level export, `.` +

>   "preserve")` (typed first-class, NOT `.meta()` keys); `spa.viewTransitions` widened `boolean → TransitionMode`;
>   new `spa.scrollRestoration`; `RenderResult` now also allows `null` (render nothing but stay mountable).
> - **`2.1.1`:** `app.spa.navigate` now commits the address bar (`history.pushState`).
> - **`2.2.0`:** module-level `navigate(path, opts?)` / `hardNavigate(url)` (bound to the booted app, no-op
>   pre-boot); `hardNavigate` does a REAL full-page load across a layout/auth boundary the SPA can't swap;
>   island ctx gains an always-present `ctx.navigate`.
> - **`2.2.1` (#91):** internal SPA fix (own the skipped-transition `ready` AbortError in `runSwap`) — no
>   public-surface change.
> - **`2.2.2` (#92):** `createChannel` gained a `shouldReconnect?(event: CloseEvent): boolean` guard — return
>   `false` to suppress the reconnect backoff on a terminal close (e.g. code `4401`); omitted = always reconnect.

> - **`::embed` lazy iframe facades + `lazyEmbed` island (v1.10.0, #70; enhanced v1.11.0, #71).**
>   `::embed{src="…" title="…" width? height?}` leaf directives rewrite to a static
>   click-to-activate `<figure data-island="lazy-embed">` — NO iframe (or its network/JS cost)
>   until the reader clicks, when the new **`lazyEmbed`** SPA island swaps in the real
>   `<iframe loading="lazy">`. `src` may be http(s), root-relative, or a co-located relative path
>   resolved to the shared `/<slug>/…` URL; `width`×`height` reserve the box aspect-ratio. Provider
>   option `embed?: boolean | { facade }` (consumer Preact facade; default `EmbedFacadeButton`);
>   requires `trustedContent: true`.
> - **`::gallery` folder galleries (v1.12.0, #72).** `::gallery{src="./images/dir/" caption="…"}`
>   reads the co-located folder at build, sorts its images, rewrites each to its shared `/<slug>/…`
>   URL, and renders them through a Preact component (default `GalleryTrack`, or consumer
>   `gallery.component`) into `<div data-island="gallery">`; the swipe/keyboard/lightbox island is
>   **consumer-provided**. Provider option `gallery?: boolean | { component }`; requires
>   `trustedContent: true`.
> - **SPA/build fixes.** v1.8.1 (#64) titleTemplate applied on DATA-path client nav; v1.8.2 (#67/#68)
>   `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` synced to the v1.8.0 cache feature + leave font `url()`s external in
>   the CSS bundle pass; v1.12.1 (#73) always scroll-to-top instant on a nav swap (never CSS smooth);
>   v1.12.2 (#74) announce the nav before the data fetch (feedback during JSON load).
>
> **New public exports (`.`):** runtime `EmbedFacadeButton`, `GalleryTrack`; types
> `EmbedFacade` / `EmbedFacadeProps` / `EmbedOptions` and `GalleryComponent` / `GalleryOptions` /
> `GalleryProps` / `GallerySlide`. **`lazyEmbed`** (+ `createIsland`) is exported from **both** `.`

## Field reference

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `key` | Short id used by `moku-sync <key>` and migration ids. |
| `npm` | Published package name; also the `package.json` dependency `/moku:upgrade` detects. |
| `repo` / `localClone` | GitHub repo (release + raw-file source) and the optional sibling working copy `moku-sync` can read offline. |
| `layer` | Moku layer: 1 = kernel (`@moku-labs/core`), 2 = framework, 3 = app (not registered — apps deploy, see `ci-release.md`). |
| `knownVersion` | Last synced version. Behind upstream ⇒ "new things available". |
| `skill` / `pluginIndex` | Skill directory this framework backs and the generated plugin/property index (`null` for the kernel — single export). |
| `dependsOn` | Other moku-family packages it requires (ordering hint: upgrade core before web). |
| `detect.packageJsonDep` | Presence of this dep in a consumer's `package.json` ⇒ the framework applies to that project. |
| `releaseSource` | `npm` (version-of-truth via `dist-tags.latest`), `github`/`releases` (notes), `packageJson` (deps/exports), `llms` (upstream `llms-full.txt` — `web` since 0.4.0, `core` since 0.1.1; cross-checked against `src/`, which wins on disagreement). |
| `upgrade.migrationId` | The `/moku:upgrade` migration that bumps this dependency (see `upgrade-migrations.md`). |
| `upgrade.distTagPolicy` | Stable → `latest`, prerelease (`-` in version, e.g. `0.1.0-alpha.6`) → its prerelease tag (mirrors `ci-release.md`). |

## Integration contract — `/moku:upgrade`

For each registry entry, when a consumer project's `package.json` contains
`detect.packageJsonDep`, `/moku:upgrade` runs the entry's `upgrade.migrationId` migration:
bump the dependency to `knownVersion` (respecting `distTagPolicy`), then run the project's
verify gate. Upgrade `@moku-labs/core` before `@moku-labs/web` when both apply
(`dependsOn` order). The migration bodies read the target **from this registry**, so a
routine version bump only edits `knownVersion` here — not the migration text.

## Integration contract — `moku-sync`

`moku-sync` loops over `frameworks[]`, resolves each `releaseSource` latest, compares to
`knownVersion`, and on a newer version regenerates that framework's skill API section +
`pluginIndex`, then writes back the new `knownVersion` here. See
`skills/moku-sync/SKILL.md`. (Newly-registered frameworks carry `knownVersion: "0.0.0"`, so the first
`moku-sync <key>` run treats everything as new and generates the catalog — see the worker/room
provenance above.)

## Reference Projects (Layer-3 examples — consult when building apps)

Layer-3 **apps** are not framework registry entries (they deploy, not publish — see the `layer` field
note). But the toolkit keeps a small set of **curated reference example apps** to consult for *idiomatic
solutions* when planning or building an app — "how does a real, well-built Moku app of this shape do X?".
The `/moku:plan` and `/moku:build` app flows (and `/moku:design`) should point at the closest reference.

| Key | What it is | Stack | Location | Status |
|-----|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| `demos/tracker` | **A public worked example for app shape** — a real Layer-3 full-stack kanban app: `@moku-labs/web` client + islands and an `@moku-labs/worker` Cloudflare backend (Durable Objects, Queues, R2, D1, KV) in one project. Illustrates the idiomatic **app shape** (`moku-idioms.md`): multiple `createApp` instances (build / browser / worker), two frameworks side-by-side, folder split by concern, a thin `cloudflare/worker.ts` entry, logic in a `tracker` plugin. Consult if a concrete reference helps — **not required**, and never assume it's checked out. | `@moku-labs/web` + `@moku-labs/worker` | public repo `github.com/moku-labs/demos` (`tracker` app) | **public** |

**Spec, not source:** a reference shows *what idiomatic looks like* — study its **structure and patterns**
and re-implement to the project's conventions; never copy a demo's source. Only list **public** references
here (a public repo or a public framework) — never a local-only path, which won't exist for a user running
the toolkit elsewhere. The primary guidance is always the **described** rubric (`moku-idioms.md`); a
reference repo is illustrative, not required.

> **How apps use this:** when `/moku:build` (App Build) or `/moku:plan` (create/update app) needs a
> pattern, **follow the described rubric in `moku-idioms.md` first**; a public reference repo (above) is an
> optional concrete example. Never instruct a reader to open a local-only path.
